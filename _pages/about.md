ðŸ”¬ Ms in Physics from the University of Antioquia in Colombia. Previously, my research focused on the application of physics to physiology, primarily utilizing finite-diference method, specifically the diffusion equation to describe how calcium spread in skeletal muscle cells. 

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Engineering at EAFIT University, where my research centers on wave propagation applied in Gephysics using ML models. 

ðŸ“š I am also interested in scientific writing using LaTeX and have had the opportunity to apply it as a freelancer for the Publishing House of the Universidad de Antioquia. 


ðŸŽ¯ The purpose of this blog is to share updates and ongoing projects.

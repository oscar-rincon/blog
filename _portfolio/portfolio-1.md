title: "EndoGPT"
excerpt: "Create synthesized medical reports so that data scientists can utilize the information to develop better visualizations and automatize processes from it. Then a classifier was implemented to evaluate the output and finally a proof of concept is performed by generating synthesized Endoscopic reports.<br/><img src='../images/endogpt.jpg' style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>"

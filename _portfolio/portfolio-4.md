## Introduction

This LaTeX document serves as a template for creating a thesis document. It includes various sections and formatting instructions to help you structure your thesis effectively.

## Initial Pages of the Book

The initial pages of the book are formatted using the `FirstPagesFormat` style and include the front page. The code for these pages can be found in the `Content/FrontPage` file.

## Table of Contents

The table of contents is generated using the `\tableofcontents` command and is placed on separate pages. To adjust the formatting, you can modify the LaTeX code accordingly.

## Introduction, Acknowledgments, Abbreviations

These sections are included in the document and can be customized to suit your specific thesis requirements. They are included using the `\include{}` command and correspond to files in the `Content/` directory.

## Book Chapters

The main content of your thesis is organized into chapters. In this template, there are three example chapters (`Content/Chapter1`, `Content/Chapter2`, `Content/Chapter3`). You can add or remove chapters as needed.

## Annexes

This section contains any annexes or additional materials relevant to your thesis. The formatting for annexes is set using the `AnexosFormat` style. You can include annexes by using the `\include{}` command and specifying the appropriate file.

## References

The references section is included in the document and can be customized to list your sources and citations appropriately. The formatting for references is typically handled by a bibliography style file.

## Colophon of the Book

The colophon section is currently commented out (`%\colophon`) in the template. You can uncomment it and provide relevant information about the document, such as the software used or other details.

Online streaming platforms like Netflix have plenty of movies in their repository. If we can build a Recommendation System to recommend relevant movies to users based on their historical interactions, this would improve customer satisfaction and hence, it will also improve the revenue of the platform. The techniques that we will learn here will not only be limited to movies; they can be applied to any item for which you want to build a recommendation system.

## Objective

In this project, we will be building various recommendation systems:

- Knowledge/Rank based recommendation system
- Similarity-Based Collaborative filtering
- Matrix Factorization Based Collaborative Filtering

We are going to use the ratings dataset.

## Dataset

The ratings dataset contains the following attributes:

- **userId**
- **movieId**
- **rating**
- **timestamp**
